## üö© Abstract
Due to the nature of cooking and food in general, recognizing foods from their visual appearance proves to be a difficult task because of the visual diversity and the
visual similarity of each type of food. In this paper, we conducted a comparative study on multiple deep learning-based models for the multi-class Thai food recognitions using food dish photos. We experimented with a total of 10 classification models, four of which are designed and trained from scratch. The other five is built upon existing pre-trained models using transfer learning. The other uses the naive feature similarity technique. To evaluate the performance of all models, we also accumulated photos from the internet and our own photos to create a dataset of 38 classes each of which has 250 images. We discovered that models from transfer learning are generally more efficient in training and more performant even when the dataset is small than the ones trained from scratch. Moreover, we also found that training models from scratch are time-consuming and troublesome because there are countless hyperparameters to be dealt with. However, despite the fact that transfer learning models are better, they are unable to distinguish and correctly classify some distinct kind of foods are visually similar.

## üñº Dataset
The dataset that we used has 9,500 images. Currently, there are 38 kinds of Thai foods, each of which has 250 images.

## üõ† Implementation

This project has 2 phases:
1. **Phase 1:** Implemented using **MATLAB**
    - There are 2 models implemented in this phase.
        1. **Image Features Vector Similarity** - This method utilizes manual image features extraction such as mean color values, texture features (e.g. homogeity, energy, entropy) along with the area size of edge and so on. This technique proves to be very naive because, for each image, features are packed as a vector and compared using cosin similarity.
        2. **Transfer Learning using CNN as a feature extractor for a SVM (Support Vector Machine)** - This method relies on a pre-trained CNN, in this case ResNet50, and another SVM. Basically, we feed an image into the pre-trained CNN in order to get the activation of the last fully-connected layer. We use that to feed train an SVM to ensure that it learns to classify our images. We repeat this process for every train image. Then we later use the train SVM to predict.
2. **Phase 2:** Implemented using **Python with Keras and TensorFlow**
    - There are 8 models implemented in this phase.
        1. First 4 models are **designed and trained from scratch**
        2. The other 4 models are pre-trained models for **transfer learning**
            - DenseNet201
            - ResNet101v2
            - ResNet50v2
            - Xception
    - Summary: The transfer learning models are obviously a better choice for its training efficiency and performance. Our custom models are outperformed by transfer learning models.

## üéì What I learned from this project
1. Training deep learning models really take a lot of time even if you have a lot of computing resources.
2. Careful parameter finetuning is very important because it means you are less like to spend less time to try it out by training.
3. Transfer learning is like a cheat to get an outstanding performance.
4. Preparing dataset is quite an time-consuming task.
5. My knowledge from deeplearning.ai 's Deep Learning course on Coursera can be applied to this project.
